I've always been intrigued by the idea of having my resume in a structured format like JSON, which allows for easy updates and different presentations based on the same data.

## What is JSON Resume?

[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) is an open source initiative to create a JSON-based standard for resumes. Having your resume in JSON format comes with several benefits:

- **Version control**: Track changes to your resume over time
- **Multiple export formats**: Generate PDF, HTML, Markdown from a single source
- **Customizable themes**: Apply different visual styles to your resume data

## My Stack Overflow Theme

I created a Stack Overflow inspired theme for JSON Resume that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow). It offers a clean, professional look for your resume that's familiar to developers.

### Features

- Clean and professional design inspired by Stack Overflow profiles
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Easy to customize with your personal information
- Support for all standard JSON Resume fields

### How to Use It

1. Install the JSON Resume CLI: `npm install -g resume-cli`
2. Install my theme: `npm install jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow`
3. Create your `resume.json` file with your information
4. Generate your resume: `resume export resume.pdf -t stackoverflow`

Give it a try and let me know what you think! Pull requests and suggestions are always welcome.
