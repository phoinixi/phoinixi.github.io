# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website, built using modern web technologies to showcase my work, share knowledge, and connect with the developer community.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** - For super-fast, content-focused static site generation
- **TailwindCSS** - For utility-first styling with minimal CSS
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Markdown/MDX** - For easy content management

## Features

### Performance Focused

The site is built with performance as a priority, achieving perfect Lighthouse scores through Astro's partial hydration approach and smart asset optimization.

### Content Collections

All content (blog posts, projects, etc.) is managed through Astro's content collections, making it easy to add, remove, or update content without touching the codebase.

### Dark Mode Support

The site includes a fully implemented dark mode that respects system preferences while allowing manual toggling.

### Responsive Design

The layout adapts seamlessly to all device sizes from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

## Architecture

The site follows a modular component architecture with:

- Reusable UI components
- Content-driven pages
- Type-safe data handling
- Optimized asset loading

This structure makes the site easy to maintain and extend over time.
