By versioning and sharing them, you can:\n\n1. 🚀 Quickly set up a new development environment\n2. 🔄 Ensure consistency across different machines\n3. 👥 Share your configurations with others\n4. 📝 Document your preferences and tools\n\n## Repository Structure 🏗️\n\nMy [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/phoinixi/dotfiles) is organized into a logical structure that makes it easy to find and modify specific configurations:\n\n```\ndotfiles/\n├── git/                    # Git configuration\n├── oh-my-zsh/              # ZSH configuration\n├── osx/                    # macOS-specific configurations\n├── utils/                  # Utility scripts\n├── .editorconfig           # Editor configuration\n├── Brewfile                # Homebrew package definitions\n├── install.sh              # Main installation script\n└── README.md               # Documentation\n```\n\nThis modular approach makes it easy to find and modify specific parts of your configuration without having to navigate through monolithic files.\n\n## Key Components of My Dotfiles ✨\n\n### Powerful Aliases 💪\n\nOne of the biggest time-savers in my dotfiles is the collection of carefully crafted aliases. Here are the ones included in the repository:\n\n#### Folders & Finder Aliases\n\nInstead of typing the same commands over and over, I use these shortcuts:\n\n```bash\n# Navigation shortcuts\nalias l=\"ls -la\"\nalias ..=\"cd ..\"\nalias ~=\"cd ~\"\nalias rm=\"rm -rf\"\nalias w=\"cd ~/workspace\"\n\n# Finder interactions\nalias finder=\"open .\"\nalias clean=\"find . -name '*.DS_Store' -type f -delete\"\n```\n\n#### Utility Aliases\n\nThese aliases make common system tasks much simpler:\n\n```bash\n# System utilities\nalias ip=\"curl ifconfig.me\"\nalias emptytrash=\"sudo rm -rfv /Volumes/*/.Trashes; rm -rfv ~/.Trash\"\nalias zip=\"zip -r\"\nalias code=\"open -a 'Visual Studio Code'\"\nalias update=\"brew update && brew upgrade && npm update -g\"\nalias chrome=\"open -a 'Google Chrome'\"\n```\n\n#### Git Aliases\n\nThe Git aliases are particularly useful for streamlining your workflow:\n\n```bash\n# Git shortcuts\nalias git\\ c=\"git commit -m\"\nalias git\\ ca=\"git commit -am\"\nalias git\\ snapshot=\"!git stash save \\\"snapshot: $(date)\\\" && git stash apply \\\"stash@{0}\\\"\"\nalias git\\ snapshots=\"!git stash list --grep snapshot\"\nalias git\\ amend=\"git commit --amend\"\nalias git\\ co=\"git checkout\"\nalias git\\ cob=\"git checkout -b\"\nalias git\\ d=\"git diff\"\nalias git\\ l=\"git log --graph --date=short\"\nalias git\\ changes=\"git log --pretty=format:\\\"%h %cr %cn %Cgreen%s%Creset\\\" --name-status\"\nalias git\\ unstage=\"git reset HEAD\"\nalias git\\ uncommit=\"git reset --soft HEAD^\"\nalias git\\ st=\"git status\"\n```\n\nThe `git snapshot` command is particularly useful for creating a quick, labeled save point without creating a formal commit.\n\n### Homebrew Package Management: The Brewfile 🍺\n\nThe Brewfile is one of the most powerful components of my dotfiles. It leverages Homebrew's bundle functionality to declaratively specify all the packages and applications needed for development.\n\nHere's a snippet from my actual Brewfile:\n\n```ruby\n# packages\nbrew \"bash\"\nbrew \"bash-completion\"\nbrew \"coreutils\"\nbrew \"curl\"\nbrew \"fnm\"\nbrew \"wget\"\nbrew \"pnpm\"\nbrew \"gh\"\nbrew \"node\"\n\n# casks with conditionals to skip if already installed\nsystem(\"brew list --cask brave-browser || brew install --cask brave-browser\")\nsystem(\"brew list --cask visual-studio-code || brew install --cask visual-studio-code\")\nsystem(\"brew list --cask chatgpt || brew install --cask chatgpt\")\nsystem(\"brew list --cask appcleaner || brew install --cask appcleaner\")\nsystem(\"brew list --cask raycast || brew install --cask raycast\")\nsystem(\"brew list --cask hyper || brew install --cask hyper\")\n```\n\nThis Brewfile automatically installs:\n\n- 🔧 Core command-line utilities (`bash`, `curl`, `wget`)\n- 💻 Development tools (`node`, `pnpm`, `gh`)\n- 📱 Applications (VS Code, Brave browser, ChatGPT, Raycast)\n\nWhen you run the installation script, Homebrew reads this file and installs everything in one go. If a package is already installed, it simply skips it.\n\n### Oh-My-Zsh Configuration 💻\n\nMy setup uses [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as the shell framework, with a customized Solarized Dark theme. This provides:\n\n- 📜 Better command history management\n- ⌨️ Improved tab completion\n- 🧩 Helpful plugins for common tools\n- 🎨 A visually appealing, informative prompt\n\nHere's what my terminal looks like with this configuration:\n\n```\nusername@machine ~/project (main) $\n```\n\nThe prompt shows your current directory and git branch at a glance, making it easier to keep track of where you are and what you're working on.\n\n### macOS System Preferences 🖥️\n\nThe repository also includes scripts in the `osx` directory that configure macOS system preferences for a developer-friendly experience:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set computer name\nsudo scutil --set ComputerName \"macbook-pro\"\nsudo scutil --set HostName \"macbook-pro\"\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName \"macbook-pro\"\n\n# Disable the sound effects on boot\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=\" \"\n\n# Expand save panel by default\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode -bool true\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode2 -bool true\n\n# Automatically quit printer app once the print jobs complete\ndefaults write com.apple.print.PrintingPrefs \"Quit When Finished\" -bool true\n\n# Disable auto-correct\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticSpellingCorrectionEnabled -bool false\n```\n\nThese settings create a more efficient development environment right from the start, with:\n\n- 🚀 Performance optimizations\n- 🖥️ Dock settings for optimal screen real estate\n- 🔍 Finder configurations for productivity\n- 🔕 System settings that reduce distractions\n\n## Why This Matters for Frontend Developers 🎯\n\nAs a frontend developer, this dotfiles configuration is specifically tailored for web development workflows:\n\n1. 📂 **Quick access to projects**: Aliases make it easy to navigate to frequently-used directories\n2. 🔄 **Streamlined Git workflow**: Aliased commands handle common patterns with fewer keystrokes\n3. 🧹 **Consistency in code style**: The `.editorconfig` ensures uniform formatting\n4. ⏱️ **Reduced setup time**: New machines are ready for productive work in minutes\n\n## Customizing for Your Needs 🛠️\n\nWhile my dotfiles are ready to use out of the box, I encourage you to fork the repository and adapt it to your preferences. The modular structure makes it easy to:\n\n- ➕ Add or remove specific tools in the Brewfile\n- 🔄 Modify aliases to match your workflow\n- ⚙️ Adjust configuration parameters\n- 🔌 Add support for additional applications\n\n## Maintaining Your Dotfiles 🔄\n\nOnce you've set up your dotfiles, it's important to keep them updated as your preferences evolve:\n\n1. 🧪 Make changes locally first to test them\n2. 💾 Commit working changes to your repository\n3. 🔄 Pull updates to other machines when needed\n4. 🧹 Periodically review and remove unused configurations\n\n## Installation 📥\n\nGetting started is simple. Just run:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/phoinixi/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && (cd ~/dotfiles && ./install.sh) && rm ~/dotfiles\n```\n\nThis one-liner clones the repository, runs the installation script, and cleans up after itself.\n\n## Conclusion 🏁\n\nA well-crafted set of dotfiles is an investment that pays dividends throughout your development career. My collection has evolved over years of professional work, and I continue to refine it as I discover new tools and techniques.\n\nWhether you use my dotfiles as a starting point or simply as inspiration for your own, I hope this article has shown the value of maintaining a versioned, portable configuration for your development environment.\n\nCheck out the [full repository on GitHub](https://github.com/phoinixi/dotfiles) and feel free to raise issues or submit pull requests if you have suggestions for improvements!\n\n---\n\n*What's your favorite dotfiles trick?

The ecosystem has several themes, but I found most of them were either outdated or missing features I wanted.\n\nI needed something that:\n- Used modern React\n- Supported multiple languages\n- Rendered markdown in descriptions\n- Looked good both on screen and in print\n\nSo I decided to build my own, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!\n\n![Resume Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-react/main/screenshot.png)\n\n## What Makes This Theme Different\n\nI've focused on creating a balance between professional appearance and modern functionality:\n\n- **React 18 & TypeScript** - Built on current tech for better maintainability\n- **Multi-language Support** - Create different versions of your resume for different languages\n- **Markdown in Descriptions** - Format your job descriptions with proper lists and emphasis\n- **Print-Optimized** - Carefully designed to look great when printed to PDF\n- **Responsive Design** - Looks good on everything from phones to desktops\n\nThe theme uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which made it much easier to create a responsive layout that prints well.\n\n## A Look Inside\n\nThe theme renders all standard sections from the JSON Resume schema:\n\n- Basic information with optional profile photo\n- Work experience with properly formatted date ranges\n- Education history\n- Skills with optional proficiency levels\n- Projects and volunteer work\n- Languages and interests\n\nHere's a small example of how work experience renders with markdown support:\n\n```json\n\"work\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Company Name\",\n    \"position\": \"Senior Developer\",\n    \"startDate\": \"2020-01-01\",\n    \"endDate\": \"2022-12-31\",\n    \"summary\": \"Led development of key products\",\n    \"description\": \"- Rebuilt the authentication system\\n- Improved performance by 40%\\n- Mentored junior developers\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis renders as properly formatted bullets in the final resume, making it much more readable than plain text.\n\n## Supporting Multiple Languages\n\nOne feature I'm particularly proud of is the multilingual support. The theme detects the language from the \"language\" property in your resume JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"basics\": {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"label\": \"Programmer\"\n  },\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"work\": [\n    // work history\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can create versions for different languages:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"basics\": {\n    \"name\": \"Jean Dupont\",\n    \"label\": \"Développeur\"\n  },\n  \"language\": \"fr\",\n  \"work\": [\n    // work history in French\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis is perfect if you're applying for jobs internationally or in bilingual markets.\n\n## The Development Process\n\nBuilding this theme taught me a lot about:\n\n1. **Optimizing for print media** - CSS for print is surprisingly tricky\n2. **Component organization** - Breaking down a resume into logical React components\n3. **Handling internationalization** - Working with dates and text in multiple languages\n4. **Balancing design and function** - Creating something that looks good but prioritizes content\n\nThe most challenging part was ensuring the theme remained faithful to the JSON Resume schema while adding extra features. I wanted to make sure it would work with existing resume data without modification.\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nIf you want to give it a spin, the theme is available on npm and GitHub. I've created detailed documentation in the repository about installation and configuration options.\n\nI'd love to hear what you think or see examples if you use it for your own resume! I'm still actively developing it and plan to add more customization options in the future.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nI'm planning several improvements:\n\n- Theme customization through configuration\n- More layout variants\n- Custom sections support\n- More export options\n\nHave you used JSON Resume before?

But how do they work under the hood? I wanted to understand this better, so I built a simple one-way data binding implementation in vanilla JavaScript.\n\n## What is one-way data binding?\n\nOne-way data binding means changes in the application state are automatically reflected in the UI, but not the other way around. The flow is:\n\n```\nModel → View\n```\n\nWhen the model (data) changes, the view (UI) updates automatically.\n\n## The implementation\n\nHere's a simple implementation of one-way data binding in vanilla JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Our model - a simple object with some data\nconst model = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 30\n};\n\n// Proxy to intercept property access and modifications\nconst handler = {\n  set(target, property, value) {\n    target[property] = value;\n    \n    // Update all elements that use this property\n    render();\n    return true;\n  }\n};\n\n// Create a reactive proxy for our model\nconst reactiveModel = new Proxy(model, handler);\n\n// Render function to update the DOM\nfunction render() {\n  // Find all elements with data-bind attribute\n  document.querySelectorAll('[data-bind]').forEach(element => {\n    const property = element.getAttribute('data-bind');\n    if (property in reactiveModel) {\n      element.textContent = reactiveModel[property];\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n// Initial render\nrender();\n\n// Example usage:\n// \u003Cdiv data-bind=\"name\">\u003C/div>\n// \u003Cdiv data-bind=\"age\">\u003C/div>\n```\n\n## How it works:\n\n1. We create a model object with our data\n2. We use JavaScript's Proxy to intercept property changes\n3. When a property changes, we call the render function\n4. The render function finds all elements with a data-bind attribute and updates them\n\n## Demo\n\nLet's see it in action:\n\n```html\n\u003C!DOCTYPE html>\n\u003Chtml>\n\u003Chead>\n  \u003Ctitle>One-way data binding in vanilla JS\u003C/title>\n\u003C/head>\n\u003Cbody>\n  \u003Ch1>Hello, \u003Cspan data-bind=\"name\">\u003C/span>!\u003C/h1>\n  \u003Cp>You are \u003Cspan data-bind=\"age\">\u003C/span> years old.\u003C/p>\n  \n  \u003Cbutton id=\"updateName\">Change Name\u003C/button>\n  \u003Cbutton id=\"updateAge\">Change Age\u003C/button>\n  \n  \u003Cscript>\n    const model = { name: 'John', age: 30 };\n    const reactiveModel = new Proxy(model, {\n      set(target, property, value) {\n        target[property] = value;\n        render();\n        return true;\n      }\n    });\n\n    function render() {\n      document.querySelectorAll('[data-bind]').forEach(element => {\n        const property = element.getAttribute('data-bind');\n        if (property in reactiveModel) {\n          element.textContent = reactiveModel[property];\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Initial render\n    render();\n\n    // Event listeners for buttons\n    document.getElementById('updateName').addEventListener('click', () => {\n      reactiveModel.name = 'Jane';\n    });\n    \n    document.getElementById('updateAge').addEventListener('click', () => {\n      reactiveModel.age = reactiveModel.age + 1;\n    });\n  \u003C/script>\n\u003C/body>\n\u003C/html>\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile this is a simplified example, it demonstrates the core concept behind one-way data binding. Modern frameworks build on these ideas with more features and optimizations, like Virtual DOM for efficient updates and change detection algorithms.\n\nIn my next post, I'll explore how to implement two-way data binding, where changes in the UI update the model as well.\n\nYou can find the complete code example on [my GitHub](https://github.com/phoinixi/one-way-data-binding).","src/content/blog/one-way-data-binding-vanilla-js.mdx","e9a292f510d188bf","one-way-data-binding-vanilla-js.mdx","two-way-data-binding-vanilla-js",{"id":216,"data":218,"body":224,"filePath":225,"digest":226,"legacyId":227,"deferredRender":69},{"title":219,"description":220,"pubDate":221,"featured":23,"tags":222},"Two-way Data Binding in Vanilla JS (POC)","Building a proof of concept for two-way data binding using plain JavaScript without any frameworks.",["Date","2019-02-02T00:00:00.000Z"],[210,173,211,223],"frontend","Data binding is a powerful concept in modern web development. While frameworks like Angular, Vue, and React offer sophisticated ways to bind data, understanding how to implement this pattern in vanilla JavaScript can deepen your understanding of these tools.\n\nIn this post, I'll demonstrate a simple two-way data binding implementation using plain JavaScript.\n\n## What is Two-way Data Binding?\n\nTwo-way data binding creates a connection between the UI and the data model:\n\n1. When the UI changes (e.g., user input), the data model updates automatically\n2. When the data model changes, the UI updates automatically\n\nFrameworks abstract this away, but the underlying concepts are straightforward.\n\n## The Implementation\n\nHere's a simple proof of concept:\n\n```javascript\nclass DataBinder {\n  constructor(objectToBind) {\n    this.data = objectToBind || {};\n    this.elements = [];\n    this.eventListeners = [];\n  }\n  \n  bind(element, property) {\n    // Store the element and property\n    this.elements.push({ element, property });\n    \n    // Set initial value\n    if (element.tagName === 'INPUT' || element.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') {\n      element.value = this.data[property] || '';\n      \n      // Add event listener to update data when input changes\n      const listener = () => {\n        this.data[property] = element.value;\n        this.updateBindings(property);\n      };\n      \n      element.addEventListener('input', listener);\n      this.eventListeners.push({ element, event: 'input', listener });\n    } else {\n      element.textContent = this.data[property] || '';\n    }\n    \n    return this;\n  }\n  \n  updateBindings(property) {\n    // Update all elements bound to this property\n    this.elements.forEach(el => {\n      if (el.property === property) {\n        if (el.element.tagName === 'INPUT' || el.element.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') {\n          el.element.value = this.data[property] || '';\n        } else {\n          el.element.textContent = this.data[property] || '';\n        }\n      }\n    });\n  }\n  \n  // Method to programmatically update data\n  set(property, value) {\n    this.data[property] = value;\n    this.updateBindings(property);\n    return this;\n  }\n  \n  // Clean up event listeners\n  unbindAll() {\n    this.eventListeners.forEach(({ element, event, listener }) => {\n      element.removeEventListener(event, listener);\n    });\n    this.elements = [];\n    this.eventListeners = [];\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n\nHere's how you could use this data binding class:\n\n```html\n\u003Cinput id=\"nameInput\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter your name\">\n\u003Cp>Hello, \u003Cspan id=\"nameDisplay\">\u003C/span>!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cbutton id=\"resetBtn\">Reset\u003C/button>\n\n\u003Cscript>\n  const person = { name: 'Francesco' };\n  const binder = new DataBinder(person);\n  \n  // Bind the input and span to the name property\n  binder.bind(document.getElementById('nameInput'), 'name')\n        .bind(document.getElementById('nameDisplay'), 'name');\n  \n  // Add reset button functionality\n  document.getElementById('resetBtn').addEventListener('click', () => {\n    binder.set('name', '');\n  });\n\u003C/script>\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis implementation is a simplified proof of concept with limitations:\n\n- It doesn't handle nested properties\n- It would need optimization for larger applications\n- No support for computed properties or watchers\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nUnderstanding how data binding works under the hood:\n\n1. Improves your mental model of frameworks\n2. Helps you debug complex binding issues\n3. Allows for custom implementation when needed\n4. Makes you a better JavaScript developer overall\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile you'd typically reach for a framework in production, building these patterns from scratch deepens your understanding of core web development concepts.\n\nThe complete code for this proof of concept is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phoinixi/vanilla-data-binding).","src/content/blog/two-way-data-binding-vanilla-js.mdx","5a75fcae4ede005f","two-way-data-binding-vanilla-js.mdx","pages",["Map",230,231,240,241,249,250,258,259,266,267],"about",{"id":230,"data":232,"body":236,"filePath":237,"digest":238,"legacyId":239,"deferredRender":69},{"title":233,"description":234,"updatedDate":235},"About Me","Learn more about me, my background, and what I'm currently working on.",["Date","2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"I'm Francesco, a software engineer with a passion for frontend development and creating intuitive user experiences.
